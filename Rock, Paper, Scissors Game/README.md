# ✊✋✌️ Rock, Paper, Scissors!
* console-based version of the beloved game, in which 2 players battle each other through a seemingly random choice. 
----  
## How to play:

* #### for each round, the player must enter their weapon of choice (rock, paper, scissors).    
     ##### - if the computer chooses a better weapon, the computer wins the round.  
     ##### - if the computer chooses a worse weapon, the player wins the round.
     ##### - otherwise, the round ends in a tie.

* #### the game can go on infinitely, until the player decides to stop.
